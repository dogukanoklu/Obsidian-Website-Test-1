# Obsidian Website Test Blog

Hi this is my first blog. This project will make it easier to publish a blog with obsidian. I like the language of go. I love backend developer jobs.

### 5 December 2024
I couldn't add anything to this project today due to school. 

### 6 December 2024
I couldn't do anything today either. Did I mention that I feel bad on days when I canâ€™t code? :D

### 7 December 2024
Yes I added something new. I also fixed my blog a little bit. I am creating the site with Hugo template. My love for Go :D I've been browsing the site and examining the codes for about an hour. Now I understand how the site works, but there is a problem, the fonts are not loaded. I will fix this situation tomorrow.

### 8 December 2024
Yesterday I understood how the site works. Today, I am making changes accordingly. Fonts are still not loading, I haven't investigated why. Settings file added. Some more development.

Yes, now your visitors can view which song you are listening to on Spotify. But the token you gave is not fully secure at the moment. Don't worry, I will find a way to keep it safe :D
